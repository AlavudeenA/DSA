Why DSA Matters :
  DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and     time it consumes. The lesser memory the code consumes and the faster it runs, the more efficient it is. How much memory = space complexity , Hom much       time it consumes = time complexity.

Why Datastructure matters:
  if you’re building a program that needs to deal with lots of data, or a web app used by thousands of people simultaneously, the data structures you         select may affect whether your software runs at all, or simply conks out because it can’t handle the load.

Array and Set:
  The array and set are one of the most basic data structures in computer science. Ex: array = ["apples", "bananas", "cucumbers", "dates", "elderberries"]
