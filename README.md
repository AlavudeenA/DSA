Why DSA Matters :

  DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and     time it consumes. The lesser memory the code consumes and the faster it runs, the more efficient it is. 

Why Datastructure matters:

  if you’re building a program that needs to deal with lots of data, or a web app used by thousands of people simultaneously, the data structures you         select may affect whether your software runs at all, or simply conks out because it can’t handle the load.
  
Why Alogrithms matters:

When applied to computing, an algorithm refers to the set of instructions given to a computer to achieve a particular task. When we write any code, then, we’re creating algorithms for the computer to follow and execute.

Lets say we want to print elements in array. The first thing to realize is that this is an example of an algorithm. While it may not be fancy, any code that does anything at all is technically an algorithm—it’s a particular process for solving a problem. The algorithm we use to solve this problem is a for loop containing a print statement.

How much memory our code consumes = space complexity , Hom much time it consumes = time complexity.

We can also express algorithms using plain English to set out the details of the instructions we plan on providing the computer. There are some algorithms have efficient space complexity, some have efficient time complexity, some have both.
