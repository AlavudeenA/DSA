Why DSA Matters :

  DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and     time it consumes. The lesser memory the code consumes and the faster it runs, the more efficient it is. How much memory our code consumes is determined by space complexity , Hom much time it consumes is determined by time complexity.

Why Datastructure matters:

  if you’re building a program that needs to deal with lots of data, or a web app used by thousands of people simultaneously, the data structures you         select may affect whether your software runs at all.
  
Why Alogrithms matters:

When applied to computing, an algorithm refers to the set of instructions given to a computer to achieve a particular task. When we write any code, then, we’re creating algorithms for the computer to follow and execute.

Sorting algorithms :

Selection Sort: Perhaps the simplest approach is to first scan through the input array to identify minimum elemnt and swap its position with first element. Every iteration left most element is sorted and sorted left most elemnt will not be swapped again. Consider first, second, third and so on elements as an element to start with in each iteration.

Insertion Sort:  It can be viewed as slicker implementation of Selection sort idea of iteratively growing a prefix of the sorted output array. i.e, Consider second, third and so on elements as temp value in each iteration and compare always with its left most sorted array elements from right to left and swap.

Bubble Sort: Identify adjacent pairs of elements that are out of order and perform repeated swaps until the array is sorted. Consider first, second, third and so on elements as an element to start with in each iteration.
