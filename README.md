Why DSA Matters :
  DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and     time it consumes. The lesser memory the code consumes and the faster it runs, the more efficient it is. How much memory it consumes = space complexity ,   Hom much time it consumes = time complexity.

Why Datastructure matters:
  if you’re building a program that needs to deal with lots of data, or a web app used by thousands of people simultaneously, the data structures you         select may affect whether your software runs at all, or simply conks out because it can’t handle the load.

Array and Set:
  The array and set are one of the most basic data structures in computer science. Ex: array = ["apples", "bananas", "cucumbers", "dates", "elderberries"]

Many data structures are used in four basic ways, which we refer to as operations. These operations are:

Read: Reading refers to looking something up at a particular spot within the data structure. With an array, this means looking up a value at a particular index. For example, looking up which grocery item is located at index 2 would be reading from the array.

Search: Searching refers to looking for a particular value within a data structure. With an array, this means looking to see if a particular value exists within the array, and if so, at which index. For example, looking up the index of "dates" in our grocery list would be searching the array.

Insert: Insertion refers to adding a new value to our data structure. With an array, this means adding a new value to an additional slot within the array. If we were to add "figs" to our shopping list, we’d be inserting a new value into the array.

Delete: Deletion refers to removing a value from our data structure. With an array, this means removing one of the values from the array. For example, if we removed "bananas" from our grocery list, this value would be deleted from the array.
