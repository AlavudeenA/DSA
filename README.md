Why DSA Matters :
  DSA is applied in problem-solving and enables developers to learn to write efficient code. The quality of the code can be judged by how much memory and     time it consumes. The lesser memory the code consumes and the faster it runs, the more efficient it is. How much memory = space complexity , Hom much       time it consumes = time complexity.
